<img align="right" hspace="15" src=images/download.jpeg>
<p>Once there lived a woodcutter in a village in Arabia. His name was Ali Baba. He was very poor. One day he was cutting the 
trees beside a mountain near by. Suddenly he heard some hoofing sound. So he climbed up the tree to watch seriously and carefully.</p>
<p>There he saw forty men riding on the horses back and went towards the mountain raising dust on their way. All of them wore masks on their faces. 
He thought they must be thieves. He watched carefully what they were doing. They all stopped before the mountain. One of them must 
be the chief, got down from the horse and walked towards a huge rock in the mountain. He stretched his hands and called Open seesee…"</p>
<p>The rock slowly moved to one side with a noise of friction. There was a narrow path in the mountain. Ali Baba found that it was a 
cave. All the thieves got down from the horses and carried heavy bags on then back inside the cave. After all of them went inside, 
the door closed Ali Baba watched it with anxiety. Some time after, they all came out of the cave and rode back as they came. The door
closed again after the forty thieves came out.</p>
<p>Ali Baba got down from the tree and walked slowly near the rock. He also stretching his hand and called loudly "Open seesee"!</p>
<p>Suddenly the door of the rock opened, slowly. Ali Baba went inside the Cave. The door closed again. In the center of the Cave
 Ali Baba saw lot of precious gems and jewels on a small stage. Gold and silver coins were also found everywhere there. On the other
 side he saw diamonds in an open box. Ali Baba was in wonder and he didn't see such amounts of wealth at a place.</p>
 <p>He was stunned for a while, but in a very short time he filled a sack with as much as he could and returned home. Ali Baba 
showed his wife the sack full of precious gems and gold. His wife was shocked for a while on seeing the wealth.</p>
<p>He said, “our worst days come to an end from today".His wife replied, “We have become very rich in a single day".
 He wanted to weigh the wealth he had in the sack. His wife went to borrow the weighing machine from Kasim All Baba's rich brother.
 As Kasim's wife was a suspicious woman, she wanted to know the reason why she got the machine.
 So she applied some gum at the bottom of the weighing machine. Ali Baba's wife brought the machine and weighed the coins. When 
 she was weighing, a gold coin stuck at the base. She returned the machine to Kasim's wife without knowing that a coin was under the machine.
 When Kasim's wife saw the coin under the machine she and Kasim become jealous.
 As Kasim was a wicked and greedy man, he wanted to know the secret of Ali Baba's wealth.
 Kasim learnt the secret from Ali Baba. He went to the mountain. Standing in front of the cave he said loudly" Open seesee!"
 The door opened. After he entered in, the door closed again On seeing the wealth he shouted in joy “All are mine from now".</p>
 <p>He quickly filled his sack and came near the door and said “Open Sasee!" But the door didn't open. "Open kasee" he said again, but the door did not move.
 Kasim had forgotten the words OPEN SEESEE to open the rock door. So he got stranded inside the cave. He tried again and again but in 
 vain. After some time later, the forty thieves came to the cave They entered the cave and found Kasim inside the cave with a
 sack full of gold."What? A new thief inside…cut his head" the chief ordered in a high voice when they came out.</p>
 <p>They killed Kasim and threw him away outside the cave. As he did not come back to his house till the evening,
 his wife got worried. He went to Ali Baba's house and asked for help. He went near the cave. He saw the body of his brother near 
 the rock door. He cried. 'Oh God, why were you so greedy? He took the body home. His wife thought that It was the punishment given by God for her greediness
  Ali Baba murmured some thing and wept for his dead brother.</p>

  <p>Once there lived a prince. He lost one of his eyes. But now he was not a prince, he wandered here and there as a noble man.</p>
  <p>One day he came to an Inn to stay for the night. He hired a room in the inn and stayed there in the night. As he liked the place 
 very much he stayed there for days. The daughter of the Inns owner met him occasionally. She took pity on him and asked, how he had 
 lost his eye.<br><br> The noble man told her that once his father was a king of a country. When he was away to his cousin kingdom, one wicked
 minister cunningly killed his father and came to the throne. While he was returning back to his country, his men captured him on the
 way. The Minister ordered to take the left eye.<br><br> “This was how I lost my one eye" he said in a low voice.</p>
 <p>The daughter of the inn asked him, “why did the minister take your eye?" he said.</p>
 <p>"The minister wanted to take revenge on me. It was also a separate story." Said that prince</p>
 <p>He then continued, “In my young age, I was wandering with bow and arrows. When I was shooting, it had hit the minister's 
 left eye unexpectedly. <br><br>So he lost his left eye and he was awaiting a suitable opportunity to revenge me. So he captured me when I 
 returned to my kingdom. I begged for mercy and told that he did not blind his eye purposefully.<br><br> But he didn't listen to my words and
 blinded my left eye and sent me from the kingdom to the forest. I was wandering in the forest for many days. One day the animal hunters
 took pity on me and brought me here. Since then I have been staying here." He finished.</p>
 <p>The Inn owners daughter said, “Your life story touched my heart and this should not happen to any one. Then the noble man left 
 the place and went on his way.</p>

 <h1 align="center" id="ManBlind">GREEDINESS CAN MAKE A MAN BLIND</h1>
 <img width="350" align="right" hspace="15" src="images\5bae7a6456e4f.jpg">
 <P>Long ago there lived a merchant Abdullah. He was very rich, but he was very greedy. One day he loaded his forty camels with costly
 spices to sell in a far away city in Arabia. He sold all the spices there. He halted in an inn to have lunch on the way back. There a 
 Holy man met Abdullah and they became friends then.The Holy man described about the secret land of enormous wealth."I also have heard 
 about it “ Abdullah said with a smile. The Holy man said, “If you bring your camels there, we will load a lot of precious stones like 
 diamonds, rubies and gold." Abdullah nodded his head as a symbol of acceptance. The Holy man further said that half of the load should 
 be given to him. Abdullah thought that it was reasonable. So he agreed the offer.</P>
 <p>Both of them travelled and reached the land fully surrounded by beautiful mountains. The Holy man sprinkled some white powder on the
 ground, taken from a small box he had. Suddenly clouds of smoke came from the powder. After, all the smoke had settled down, he saw a
 way there. When both of them went through the path they found a cave with full of gems and gold coins.The Holy man asked Abdullah to 
 come in. He moved inside the cave. There he saw the treasure which he never had seen before. He quickly took them and filled his bags
 and loaded them on the camels. When he completed the loading of all the forty camels, the Holy man told Abdullah that he should take
 twenty camels, as his share.</p>
 <p>On hearing that Abdullah said to the Holy man, “ why are you in need of such a wealth?, you may take only ten. I will take thirty".
 The Holy man agreed to that with a smile. Some time later, the greedy Abdullah again said, “Even the ten would be a burden to a Holy man
 like you, so you may take five only".Again the Holy man agreed. But Abdullah was not satisfied with that. So he asked him to give the
 five also to him. The Holy man nodded his head with a smile. Even then Abdullah was not satisfied. So he again asked him to give the 
 magical powder too as the Holy man needed it no more. Only then the holy man warned Abdullah that the powder might cause danger if it
 was not used properly.Further he said that it turned everything to gold when rubbed on the left eye. “But you would be blind
 if you rubbed it on your right eye he said. </p>
 <p>As his greed grew more, Abdullah did not care about the danger. He compelled the holy man to give the powder. After a while the 
 holy man gave the magical powder with the box and left the place.<br>Abdullah could not control his curiosity. He quickly started to
 rub some powder on his left eye. All of a sudden the entire thing which he saw with his left eye changed into gold. Then he thought 
 that if he rubbed the powder on both the eyes, the whole world would turn as gold.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the warning of the Holy man, he rubbed the powder on his right eye also. At the very next movement he became blind. 
 He cried with pain and said,"God…I was too greedy". But it was too late, for he had become totally blind.</p>

 <img  width="250" align="right" hspace="15" src="images\716NDSVb8vL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg">
 <P>Long years ago, Zaman was the Prince of a small Arab kingdom. He went to a nearby forest with his Princess Badora for a camp.
 After the meals the Princess removed all her jewels to take rest in the tent.When the Princess put the jewels beside her, a bird flew 
 down fast and took a jewel with a Ruby stone. On hearing the sound of the flying bird she cried for help “Alah! My precious stone."<br>
 The Prince said "Don't worry. I will surely get it back dear." He soon hurried towards the direction of the flying bird which took the 
 jewel The Prince ran very fast as he could. But it was very difficult for him to chase the bird by land. In a few minutes the bird was
 far away and finally went out of sight.He said. ‘What can I do now?" He had gone very deep in the thick forest and finally he lost the
 way and stopped there for a while. There he remembered the Princess Badora. He thought 'Alah my Princess was alone in the camp.
 I shall go back fast to meet the Princess."</P>
 <p>He tried to return back through thorns and thick bushes At end he reached the place where he left the Princess. But for his shock
 there was no Princess. So he cried, “O my dear Badora! Where are you dear?" But it was in vain. There was no reply from his wife.
 Princess Badora had waited for some time there. She was scared by the forest animals. So she wandered here and there and finally came
 to a Kingdom on the other side of the forest. The Kingdom was ruled by King Aram. She narrated what happened in the forest. 
 King Aram took pity on her and allowed her to stay in his Palace till her husband Zaman rescued her.But Zaman was wandering here and
 there and came to a beautiful garden. He was very tired and could not walk too. So he wanted to take rest in the garden for a while. 
 He sat under a shadow of a big tree At the top, some birds were fighting with each other. He saw keenly what they were trying to snatch
 from the other bird. To his wonder one bird dropped something from her beak. When it came down, it glittered brightly.<br>Zaman jumped 
 quickly and picked up the glittering object before the birds tried. On seeing the object he shouted in joy, “Here is my wife's Ruby" I am very lucky. Oh! God."
 And put it in his bog but he felt sod because he missed his Badora and could not find her anywhere in the forest.</p>
